# AddressManagement

Steps to run the project:

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. Access http://localhost:8080 for the website

Notes:
* The app uses Local Storage to store data
* The app currently supports 2 input methods: 
  - Method 1: A Form with simple text inputs
  - Method 2: A Google Map dialog with the ability to pick location on a map
* To pick a location from the map dialog, simply double click on the map
* The text box on the map dialog is just for previewing the address, not editable
* The "Export to CSV" link only appears when there is at least 1 address on the table
* The exported csv file displays well on http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-viewer-editor.htm
